I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Duke University in the Department of Political Science. My research explores how citizens interact with information about politics and form preferences. I am particularly interested in the causes and consequences of political misinformation and misperceptions. 

My work has been published, or is forthcoming, in the *American Journal of Political Science*, *Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences*, and *Public Opinion Quarterly*.
