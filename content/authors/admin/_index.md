I am a postdoctoral research associate at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.mit.edu/) \& [Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/). I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Political Science at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) in the spring of 2021, where I was a member of the [Duke Polarization Lab](https://www.polarizationlab.com/) and [Duke Initiative on Survey Methodology](https://dism.duke.edu/). 

My research is at the intersection of political behavior and methodology, with a specific focus on misinformation and polarization. I draw on theories from cognitive and social psychology and use a wide range of methods, including field experiments, surveys, and natural language processing with social media data. 

My work has been published in the [*American Journal of Political Science*](http://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12624), [*Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences*](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/1/243/tab-figures-data), and *Public Opinion Quarterly* [(here](https://academic.oup.com/poq/advance-article/doi/10.1093/poq/nfaa026/6056667) and [here](https://www.brianguay.com/files/GuayLopez_2020_rr.pdf)).
