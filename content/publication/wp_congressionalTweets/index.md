abstract: Legislator preferences are typically represented as measures of general ideology estimated from roll call votes on legislation, potentially masking important nuances in legislators' political attitudes. In this paper we introduce a method of measuring more specific legislator attitudes using an alternative expression of preferences--- tweeting. We incorporate the frequency, timing, and sentiment of tweets into representations of legislators' attitudes using a neural net approach. To illustrate our method, we model legislators' attitudes toward President Trump using tweets authored by members of the U.S. House and Senate related to the president from November 2016 to February 2018. Legislator attitudes towards Trump are represented as vector embeddings, and Trump himself is represented as a vector constructed using a neural network from the text of his daily tweets. The interaction between legislator embeddings and Trump embeddings produces predictions of both the number of times legislators tweet about Donald Trump and the sentiment of tweets about Donald Trump. We assess the quality of our learned representations for legislators by comparing to traditional measures of legislator preferences, legislators' likelihood of supporting Trump-endorsed legislation, and support for Trump in legislators' constituencies. The proposed method offers a promising approach for measuring political preferences.
