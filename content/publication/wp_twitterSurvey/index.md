abstract: Levels of affective polarization---the dislike and distrust of members of the opposing political party---have risen steadily over the last two decades. Despite the growing prevalence of online political discourse and research examining issue-based ideological divides on social media, little scholarly attention has been paid to the consequences of affective polarization for behavior on social media. In this paper, we survey a national sample of 1,239 partisans and track their activity on Twitter to examine how behavior on social media varies across levels of affective polarization. We use a combination of supervised and unsupervised text-as-data methods, including word embedding, lexicon-based sentiment analysis, and random forest models to identify the political relevance, partisan leaning, and sentiment of approximately 2 million tweets authored by respondents in our sample. Specifically, we assess how the sentiment of tweets about Democrats and Republicans correlate with traditional survey measures of affective polarization. Next, we build models to predict individualsâ€™ political affect with social media posts and specify which behaviors constitute the best predictors.
