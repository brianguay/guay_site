## About Me


When I'm not working, I'm outside hiking, playing with my dog, geeking out about space, or finding old typewriters to add to my collection. I grew up near Boston and have lived in Washington DC, Richmond VA, and Durham NC. Go Sox! Go Spiders!**

Some pics of my favorite hikes, typewriters, and dog (Dobby):
