## About Me


When I'm not working, I'm outside hiking, playing with my dog, geeking out about space, or finding old typewriters to add to my collection. I grew up near Boston and have lived in Washington DC, Richmond VA, and Durham NC. Go Sox! Go [Spiders](https://urnow.richmond.edu/spiderpride/article/-/14840/fear-the-spiders-when-your-school-has-the-no.-1-most-frightening-mascot-.html)!

Some pics of my favorite hikes, typewriters, and dog (Dobby):
